## About RiverDevTest

A website made using Vue, Laravel, and TailwindCSS.

For this website to properly work locally, I created a database with phpmyadmin running XAMPP and named it riverdevtest, though the name can be different as long as it is updated in the .env file. The migrations will also have to be run to include the bookings table.
